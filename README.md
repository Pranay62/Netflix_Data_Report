**Netflix_Data_Report**

Welcome to the Netflix Data Report project! We have cleaned the Netflix dataset with SQL and are now ready to visualize it using Tableau.
Our goal is to generate insights and report on the data in a clear and informative manner.

We have utilized the cleaned dataset, which can be found here, to generate a Tableau dashboard. 
The dashboard will showcase visualizations that summarize the following aspects of the dataset:

    The number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix
    The distribution of movies and TV shows by release year
    The top 10 countries producing content on Netflix
    The most common movie and TV show ratings
    The top 10 genres on Netflix

We will be using Tableau to create interactive visualizations to better understand the data and to derive insights that can help us make informed decisions.

Feel free to explore the dashboard, which can be found here, and gain valuable insights from the data.
