# Netflix Data Report

Welcome to the Netflix Data Report project! In this project, we have cleaned the Netflix dataset using SQL and created a PowerBi dashboard to visualize the data. Our objective is to provide insights and analysis on the Netflix dataset in a clear and informative manner.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details such as release year, country of production, ratings, and genres.

## PowerBi Dashboard

The PowerBi dashboard we have created showcases various visualizations to summarize key aspects of the Netflix dataset. The following insights can be gained from the dashboard:

- Number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix
- Distribution of movies and TV shows by release year
- Top 10 countries producing content on Netflix
- Most common movie and TV show ratings
- Top 10 genres on Netflix


## Repository

The project is available on GitHub under the project name [Netflix_Data_Report](https://github.com/Pranay62/Netflix_Data_Report). You can access the repository to view the PowerBi dashboard, the SQL scripts used for data cleaning, and any additional resources or documentation related to the project.
